# Relaxation

INCAR.relax : 
1) ISIF = 3 for bulk relaxation
2) ENCUT 130% larger than ENMAX when cell shape and volume will be changed (PulayStress)
3) Gaussian smearing be good for most cases
4) start from scratch ISTART = 0 , ICHARG = 2
5) cores in Si.pbs set to 8 (# of atoms)
6) turn off CHGCAR and WAVECAR

KPOINTS.grid:

do a kpoints convergence test(using kpoints_test.sh and draw_results.sh)
it will be OK if two adjent energy is less than 0.01 eV
choose 6 6 6 (kpoints.sh 6 6 6)

POSCAR

conventional cell contaning 8 Si atoms (2 atoms in primitive cell) created from Material Studio

# scf

cp relaxed structure (CONTCAR) here

INCAR.scf:
1) NO ionic step
2) turn on CHGCAR (LCHARG = .TRUE.)
3) cp CONTCAR POSCAR

# dos

cp CHGCAR here

INCAR:

1) read from CHGCAR (ISTAR = 1,ICHAGR = 11,it's ok not to set,it is defalt setting if CHGCAR exist)
2) ISMEAR = -5 for dos calculation
3) LORBIT = 11 for projected dos on atoms and orbitals
4) NEDOS = 3000 to resolve peaks (default 301)
5) others stay same as INCAR.scf

KPOINTS:

enlarge grid to 21  21  21 for dos

## cat DOSCAR for some summary


## get vasprun.xml , and visualize in p4vasp:
TOTal DOS: show DOS + BAND
Projected DOS: electronic ->  Local Dos and Band -> 1. Si  2. 3.0(size) 3. diselect all,choose one  4. Add a New line

## using vaspkit to get TDOS and PDOS and visualize it in Originlab


# soi

# INCAR.soi

Compared to INCAR.scf

1) add LORBIT = 11 for projected band
2) add NBANDS = 24 (go to scf folder , grep NBANDS OUTCAR , or NION/2 + NELECT /2)

# KPOINTS

go to scf folder,use vaspkit to genrate KPATH.in and HIGH_SYMMETRY_POINTS

cp KPATH.in KPOINTS.band , change 20 to 100  in KPOINTS.band file


## get vasprun.xml , and visualize in p4vasp:
TOTal BAND: show DOS + BAND -> show BAND 
Projected DOS: electronic ->  Local Dos and Band -> 1. Si  2. 3.0(size) 3. diselect all,choose one  4. Add a New line

## using vaspkit to get BAND.dat and PBAND.dat and visualize it in Originlab

## cat BAND_GAP to the a summary
