# INCAR

Initial magnetic moments of 2¦ÌB (Ni) and 0¦ÌB (O)  

AMIX specifies the linear mixing parameter.

BMIX sets the cutoff wave vector for Kerker mixing scheme. 

The parameters for the mixing are optimal if the mean eigenvalue ¦£mean=1, and if the width of the eigenvalue spectrum is minimal. 
For an initial linear mixing (BMIX¡Ö0) an optimal setting for AMIX can be found easily by setting AMIXoptimal=AMIXcurrent*¦£mean. 
For the Kerker scheme (IMIX=1) either AMIX or BMIX can be optimized, but we recommend to change only BMIX and keep AMIX fixed 
(you must decrease BMIX if the mean eigenvalue is larger than one, and increase BMIX if the mean eigenvalue ¦£mean<1).

AMIX_MAG linear mixing parameter for the magnetization density. AMIX_MAG = 1.6

BMIX_MAG sets the cutoff wave vector for Kerker mixing scheme(IMIX=1 and/or INIMIX=1) for the magnetization density.

There are only a few other parameter combinitions which can be tried, if convergence turns out to be very slow. 
In particular, for slabs, magnetic systems and insulating systems (e.g. molecules and clusters), an initial "linear mixing" can result 
in faster convergence than the Kerker model function.[1] One can therefore try to use the following setting£º


AMIX     = 0.2
BMIX     = 0.0001 ! almost zero, but 0 will crash some versions
AMIX_MAG = 0.8
BMIX_MAG = 0.0001 ! almost zero, but 0 will crash some versions

# POSCAR

The sixth line specifies the constituting elements (in the order how they appear in the POTCAR file). 
The seventh line supplies the number of atoms per atomic species 

AFM coupling: 4 atoms in the basis (instead of 2).


# OUTPUT

The total magnetic moment should be 0 in the OSZICAR file

The partial and integrated magnetic moments within the PAW spheres are given in the OUTCAR file

The example total DOS and the partial l-decomposed DOS for the d orbitals of Ni should look like the following (see png)
