##ã€€INCAR_relax:

1).In order to do phonon calculation,need accurate relaxation EDIFF = 1e-8 and EDIFFG = -1e-8

2).ISIF = 3,therefore at least 30% higher than ENMAX for each element in the POTCAR,set ENMAX = 400

3).The van der Waals (vdW) correction to the GGA functional is included by using the density functional theory long-range dispersion 
correction (DFT-D2) method of Grimme. Set LVDW = .True

4).All calculations are performed with the spin-polarized case when considering spin-orbit interactions. Therefore add ISPIN = 2

5). Note!!!  For 2d material,ISIF = 3 may relax away the vacumm !!! ISIF=4 relaxes only the cell shape at fixed volume. 
This will also change the thickness of the vacuum layer (a bit) but it can never collapse it. So use ISIF=4 for an all-in-one relaxation.
 
But don't forget to increase the cutoff then in order to avoid Pulay stresses.
And overall precision settings (PREC, EDIFF, etc.) should be "high". As you mentioned ISIF=2 gives you more symmetric structures: 
With ISIF=4 you can never avoid a small symmetry break due to noise in the stress tensor and the quality of the stress tensor is 
very sensitive with respect to e.g. convergence of wave functions etc. and for that reason it must be a high-quality calculation.

We strongly recommend to use only Gamma centered grids for hexagonal lattices
