# INCAR


Initialization of moment along z-direction (out of plane) (MAGMOM = 0.0 0.0 1.0).

Spin-orbit interaction switched on (LSORBIT=.TRUE.).

For the second calculation, switch to in-plane magnetization by setting MAGMOM = 1.0 0.0 0.0 in the INCAR file.


LNONCOLLINEAR = .TRUE. | .FALSE.
Default: LNONCOLLINEAR = .FALSE. 

Description: LNONCOLLINEAR specifies whether fully non-collinear magnetic calculations are performed.

Setting LNONCOLLINEAR = .TRUE. in the INCAR file allows to perform fully non-collinear magnetic structure calculations. 
VASP is capable of reading WAVECAR and CHGCAR files from previous non-magnetic or collinear calculations, 
it is however not possible to rotate the magnetic field locally on selected atoms.

Hence, in practice, we recommend to perform non-collinear calculations in two steps:

First, calculate the non magnetic groundstate and generate a WAVECAR and CHGCAR file.
Second, read the WAVECAR and CHGCAR file, and supply initial magnetic moments by means of the MAGMOM tag (compare MAGMOM).

For a non-collinear setup, three values must be supplied for each ion in the MAGMOM line. 

The three entries correspond to the initial local magnetic moment for each ion in x, y and z direction respectively. The line£º

MAGMOM = 1 0 0   0 1 0

initialises the magnetic moment on the first atom in the x-direction, and on the second atom in the y direction. 
Mind, that the MAGMOM line supplies initial magnetic moments only if ICHARG = 2, 
or if the CHGCAR file contains only charge but no magnetisation density.


VOSKOWN = 0 | 1
Default: VOSKOWN = 0 

Description: Determines whether Vosko-Wilk-Nusair interpolation is used or not.

The Vosko, Wilk and Nusair interpolation usually enhances the magnetic moments and the magnetic energies.
Setting this tag is not required for most modern functions, such as the PBE or PBEsol functional, 
since these functional strictly follow the original publications and disregard the setting of this flag entirely

LMAXMIX = [integer]
Default: LMAXMIX = 2 

Description: LMAXMIX controls up to which l-quantum number the one-center PAW charge densities are passed through the 
charge density mixer and written to the CHGCAR file.

L(S)DA+U calculations require in many cases an increase of LMAXMIX to 4 for d-electrons (or 6 for f-elements) 
in order to obtain fast convergence to the groundstate.

From the energy difference of these calculations we see that the easy axis lies in plane
