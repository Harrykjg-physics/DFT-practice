##ã€€INCAR_relax:

1).In order to do phonon calculation,need accurate relaxation EDIFF = 1e-8 and EDIFFG = -1e-8

2).ISIF = 3,therefore at least 30% higher than ENMAX for each element in the POTCAR,set ENMAX = 400

3).The van der Waals (vdW) correction to the GGA functional is included by using the density functional theory long-range dispersion 
correction (DFT-D2) method of Grimme. Set LVDW = .True

4).All calculations are performed with the spin-polarized case when considering spin-orbit interactions. Therefore add ISPIN = 2

We strongly recommend to use only Gamma centered grids for hexagonal lattices
